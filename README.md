# Board-orientation-using-Accelerometer-and-Magnetometer
To obtain the orientation of the IoT board, readings from accelerometer and magnetometer are used. With the info receiving from accelerometer, it is only possible to calculate rotation angles pitch and roll and to calculate yaw the magnetometer readings were used. Magnetometer has been calibrated to compensate for soft-iron and hard-iron errors.
